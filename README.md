# Leafy 🍃

Leafy is an iOS app designed as a student-focused learning project.
It helps track study sessions, manage breaks, and reflect on personal well-being after each session — all wrapped in a nature-inspired interface meant to create a calm and pleasant study environment.

This project was built using **SwiftUI** and relies on **CoreData** for persistence. The codebase was written early in the learning journey, so expect a few creative solutions (and some outright abominations). CoreData, while functional here, is also somewhat dated compared to modern options — but it served its purpose for the project.

Requires **iOS 16 or later**.

## About the Project 📚

Leafy was created as part of a learning initiative, experimenting with app structure, UI concepts, and basic persistence.
It’s not meant to be a production-ready example — just a small step in the journey of building iOS applications.
